## Cleaning and preperation:
- extract the hours of the weather data and the data with idle time
- merge these 2 datasets
- in case of missing hours --> forward filling
- clean up code
- extract only important attributes from weather, not all

## For descriptive analysis:
- more visualization and explain what it is for
### Station-level insight
- heatmap per month / season: how many bikes get rented from every station?
